Hello Mr. Engagement Partner,

I have thoroughly done the data analysis on the provided dataset, and believe me I found some really important insights that can be the potential input for the company's future strategic initiatives and empower it to make informed decision making.

Insights:
1. 80% of your Ex-Customers are not senior citizens and independent working professionals.
Almost 90% were subscribed to phone-call service.
#Recommendation:
You need to optimize your phone-call service and serve at a competitive price point, as busy working professionals have tight schedules and don't want to compromise on the quality service of calls.

2. Almost 70% of your Ex-customers were using month-to-month recharge plans, and also have Fiber optics internet service.
#Recommendation:
Need to evaluate the quality of internet service of Fiber optics. After the hybrid mode or From-home mode became the preference of young professionals, the fiber optics market became very critical and of high potential opportunities.

3. 25 % of your current Customers are on month-to-month recharge plans, so there is potential to have customers lose almost 25% of your current customer base.
# Recommendation:
Provide offers on yearly recharge plans to retain them for longer.

4. Popular subscription services are:
* phone-call service
* Internet service
* Streaming movies
* Streaming TVs
And the demand of others is less including:
* online-Backup
* online-Security
* Device Protection
* Tech Support.

# Recommedation:
Focus on Improving the quality of popular subscription services.

These are all of the key things regarding my work and efforts, let me know your views.
Looking forward to your response.
