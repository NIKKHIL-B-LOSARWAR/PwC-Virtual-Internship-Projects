### Problem Statement:
* The Human Resources department at our telecom client is deeply committed to diversity and inclusion. Despite their efforts to improve gender balance at the executive management level, they have not observed any progress. Seeking assistance, they have reached out to us.

* The company recognizes that a diverse workforce, with talents and backgrounds, is essential for success in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. For our client, diversity and inclusion are not just optional; they are business imperatives. They strive for all teams to feel welcome and valued. However, achieving this goal and unlocking its potential pose practical challenges.

* As a Data Analyst, you are tasked with addressing the client's business problem. Your responsibility is to assist them in evaluating their workforce's diversity and inclusion. This involves providing a well-defined interactive data analysis dashboard focusing on key analytical aspects such as:
  1. Relevant KPIs.
  2. Employee analysis based on various classification matrices, including department, job level, gender, nationality, etc.
  3. Classification of staff based on matrices such as newly hired, ex-employee, PRA status, etc.
